Convenient tool for document storage and retrieval in a common format. Documents are converted using TEI recommandation and are retrieved either as single document or corpus :

- collect and upload various kinds of documents (PDF, DOC, TXT, ...)

- apply encoding normalization and conversion (thanks to Tika)

- search your collection (Solr-enabled search engine) to build a coherent set of documents

- consolidate the result in a single TEILite UTF-8 file for grammar building purposes.

- advanced search functionnalities (faceted search, search by format, date, etc)

- auto-detect document language

- crawl websites to add more document to your corpus.
